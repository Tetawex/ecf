tutorial0=There is a field with elements. The goal is to clear it by joining cells with opposite elements until you run out of mana(turns).
tutorial1=Fire and Water are the opposites. So click on the fire cell, then on the water cell in order to destroy both.
tutorial2=Darkness and Light interact with each other in a similar manner. Move the darkness cell to the light cell.
tutorial3=Air is the opposite to Earth. However, there are two air cells but only one earth cell. So u should move the top air cell to the bottom air cell to leave only one air element.
tutorial4=Now move the air tile to the earth one to clear those.
tutorial5=Move the upper cell to the lower cell. Note that joining did not yield any mana nor score, as you get 2 mana points for each pair of opposites destroyed. 
tutorial6=Move the upper cell to the lower cell.
tutorial7=Note that not only everything was destroyed, but you've got 2000 points instead of regular 100. Destroying multiple pairs of elements is highly rewarded.
tutorial8=Now you are ready to try some real levels. Have fun exploring the Elementality!

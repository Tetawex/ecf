tutorial0=In front of you there is a field filled with cells containing elements. The goal of each level is clearing the field by joining cells with opposite elements together.
tutorial1=In the right upper corner is a number of available turns left. Each move requires spending 1 turn. Successfully merging opposite elements adds 2 turns the overall count.
tutorial2=There are 6 different elements, 3 of which are opposite to other 3. Fire and Water are the first such pair. To destroy them choose the cell with Fire by clicking on it, then click on the one with the Water.
tutorial3=The second pair of opposite elements is Darkness and Light. Repeat the previous step by moving the cell with darkness to the cell with light.
tutorial4=The last opposite pair is Air and Earth. Note that although there are two Air cells there is only one cell containing Earth. To even the numbers and destroy them you need to combine the upper Air cell with the bottom one. Doing that will leave you with one Air and one Earth element.
tutorial5=Merge the cells like you did before to advance.
tutorial6=Now try to move the upper cell to the lower cell. You may notice that joining them did not yield any turns nor score, as you get 2 turns ONLY when a pair of opposites is destroyed.
tutorial7=In order to finish the tutorial move the top cell to the bottom one.
tutorial8=Combining 3 pair of elements at once increased the amount of points from 100 to 2000
tutorial9=Now you have learned the ropes and ready to try some real levels. Have fun exploring Elementality!

mottutorial0=The long-awaited update is finally here! It brings a new gameplay mechanic - Time element
mottutorial1=The Time is different form regular elements. It is opposite to itself and gives no bonus turns on merge. Move bottom cell to top to see how it in action.
mottutorial2=Another thing about the Time element is that while it is present in a cell, it 'stops time' inside it meaning no opposites can destroy each other. Move the top cell to the bottom.
mottutorial3=Duplicate elements still merge into one though. Move the right cell to the left.
mottutorial4=A cell with a Time element can hold up to 7 elements at a moment
mottutorial5=Merging two cells with Time elements resolves the whole combined set. Move the right cell to the left.
mottutorial6=Now that you're familiar with the new gameplay element, it's time to try out some real levels.
mottutorial7=The new level pack is extremely tough. You have been warned.

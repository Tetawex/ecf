tutorial0=There is a field with cells containing various elements. The goal of each level is to clear it by joining cells with opposite elements
tutorial1=In the right upper corner is a turn indicator. Each movement requires 1 turn, if you successfully merged  opposite elements 2 turns will be added to your overall count.
tutorial2=There are total of 6 elements, half of which are opposite to others. Fire and Water are first such pair. To destroy them choose cell with Fire by clicking on it, then click on one with the Water.
tutorial3=Another pair of elements are Darkness and Light. Repeat previous step by moving darkness to the cell with light.
tutorial4=The last opposite pair are Air and Earth. However, there are two Air cells but only one tile with Earth. To even numbers of elements and destroy them you need to combine upper Air cell with the bottom one, that would leave you with one Air and one Earth element.
tutorial5= Merge them like in previous steps to continue.
tutorial6=Now try to move the upper cell to the lower cell. You may notice that joining them did not yield any turns nor score, as you get 2 turns ONLY when pair of opposites are destroyed.
tutorial7= To finish this tutorial level move the top cell to the bottom one.
tutorial8= You can see that by combining multiple elements your points for that merge raised from 100 to 2000, so try to destroy higher number of elements at once.
tutorial9=Now you have learned the ropes and ready to try some real levels. Have fun exploring the Elementality!

tutorial0=There is a field with cells containing various elements. The goal of each level is to clear it by joining cells with opposite elements
tutorial1=In the right upper corner is a turn indicator. Each movement requires 1 turn, if you successfully merged  opposite elements 2 turns will be added to your overall count.
tutorial2=There are total of 6 elements, half of which are opposite to others. Fire and Water are first such pair.  To destroy them choose cell with Fire by clicking on it, then click on one with the Water.
tutorial3=Another pair of elements are Darkness and Light. Repeat previous step by moving darkness to the cell with light.
tutorial4=The last opposite pair are Air and Earth. However, there are two Air cells but only one tile with Earth. To even numbers of elements and destroy them you need to combine upper Air cell with the bottom one, that would leave you with one Air and one Earth element.
tutorial5= Merge them like in previous steps to continue.
tutorial6=Now try to move the upper cell to the lower cell. You may notice that joining them did not yield any turns nor score, as you get 2 turns ONLY when pair of opposites are destroyed.
tutorial7= To finish this tutorial level move the top cell to the bottom one.
tutorial8= You can see that by combining multiple elements your points for that merge raised from 100 to 2000, so try to destroy higher number of elements at once.
tutorial9=Now you have learned the ropes and ready to try some real levels. Have fun exploring the Elementality!
lc_no_mana=No turns left while level not being cleared
lc_no_fire=Oh no! You have drown! No fire left while water still being present on the level
lc_no_water=Burnt alive! No water left while fire still being present on the level
lc_no_air=Suffocated! No air left while earth still being present on the level
lc_no_earth= No ground under feet! No earth left while air still being present on the level
lc_no_shadow=You have become a saint! No shadow left while light still being present on the level
lc_no_light=Darkness consumed you! No light left while shadow still being present on the level
lc_no_time=Out of time! If you see this message, it's probably some kind of bug(or level is invalid)

mottutorial0=The long-awaited update is finally there! It has brought a new gameplay mechanic - Time element
mottutorial1=The Time is different form regular elements though. It is opposite to itself and gives no bonus turns on merge. Move bottom cell to top to see how it works.
mottutorial2=Another thing about the Time is that while it is present in a cell, no opposites can destroy each other. Move the top cell to the bottom.
mottutorial3=Duplicate elements do merge in one though. Move the right cell to the left.
mottutorial4=All that means that a cell with time can hold up to 7 elements at once
mottutorial5=Merging two cells with time will resolve the whole combined set. Move the rgiht cell to the left.
mottutorial6=Now that you're familiar with the new gameplay mechanic, it's time to try out some real levels.
mottutorial7=New level pack is extremely tough. Approach with a great amount of caution.
